INSTALL
    From https://github.com/MikeAxtell/TargetFinder, copy the
    'targetfinder.pl' and 'Shuffler.pl' scripts to your PATH (for instance,
    /usr/local/bin/).

    Retrieve and install ssearch36 from the FASTA package
    (http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_down.shtml). Copy the
    compiled 'ssearch36' binary to your PATH. If you want to use some other
    version of ssearch, open up targetfinder.pl and edit the code
    accordingly so that correct binary name is specified.

    Retrieve and install the uShuffle program from
    http://digital.cs.usu.edu/~mjiang/ushuffle/. Compile the C version on
    your system, and rename it from the default name of 'main.exe' to
    'uShuffle'. Copy the 'uShuffle' binary to your PATH.

USAGE
    Usage: Shuffler.pl [options] -s <sequence> -d <transcriptome.fasta> >
    output_table.txt

    Options:

     -q <string> : Query name (deafults to 'query').

     -c <float> : Max score to test for (default = 8).

     -t <int> : # of threads for Smith-Waterman search (default = 1).

     -n <int> : Number of shuffle permutations used to derived median value (default = 10).

     -f <float> : False discovery rate .. alignments estimated to have FDR at or below this (default = 0.25).

     -r       : Also search the reverse strand for targets.

     -a       : Show all alignments regardless of FDR cutoff

     -h       : Print help message and quit.

OUTPUT
    Predicted targets that meet the specified FDR cutoff are printed to
    STDOUT in the targetfinder.pl 'table' tab-delimited format.

    Information about the run is sent to STDERR. Abbreviations:

    HitsC: Cumulative number of hits with the true query

    ShufC: Cumulative median number of hits from the shuffled queries.

    TP: True Positives

    FP: False Positives

    FN: False Negatives

    TN: True Negatives

    ACC: Accuracy ... (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

    FDR: False Discovery Rate .. FP / (FP + TP)

METHODS
    The basic idea is to compare the number of hits obtained with a real
    query to the number of hits expected from randomized control queries,
    and use that ratio to compute a false discover rate.

    The shuffled queries are controlled (by uShuffle) to maintain identical
    dinucleotide content as the real query, so as to avoid any biases
    resulting from dinucleotide composition.

    'Positives' (P) are defined as the HitsC value at a given score cutoff,
    and 'Negatives' (N) are defined as the maximum HitsC value minus
    'Positives'

    From there, TP and FP are separated. TP are defined as Positives -
    ShufC, with a lower limit of zero. FP is then computed as P - TP.

    FN is calculated as N - iShufC, where iShufC is the inverse of the ShufC
    value. TN is then calculated as N - FN.

NOTES AND CAVEATS
    This method takes advantage of the long-known fact that many plant
    microRNA targets have frequencies of complementary sites in the
    transcriptome at rates far higher than is expected from random chance
    (for instance, see Rhoades et al. 2002 Cell PMID: 12202040 Figure 1).

    However, lack of confident prediction by this method should not be taken
    to be evidence against the reality of any given target site. Instead,
    lack of evidence simply means that, using alignments alone, sites of
    that quality would be expected by random chance, and so further
    experimental evidence would be needed to support the idea of it being a
    target site.
